Quick set up guide

This version is separated into client and server folders.

1. Clone repo with "git clone https://github.com/osucovid/covid_capstone.git"
2. -> Not needed at the moment, Vue will run clientside only now <- Within the server folder, install dependencies with 'run "npm i express cors mongodb nodemon body-parser"'
3. Within the client folder, install Vue with manual option.
  - Select: Babel, Router, CSS-Preprocessors, Linter / Formatter
  - Enable history mode
  - Select: Sasss/SCSS 
  - Select: ESLint with error preventio only
  - Select: Lint and fix on commit
  - Select: In dedicated config files
4. Run Vue locally with, 'npm run serve' 

*bootstrap-vue should be installed too, apologies if the instructions cause errors...
